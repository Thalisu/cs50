# IA

### Decision trees

    algorithm that tells what the IA must do in determined situations

### MiniMax

    Uses a human to tell if the machine has done something good, neutral or bad with points like, -1 for bad, 0 for neutral, or 1 to good

### Machine learning

    Technique where algorithms learn from some data to improve machine decisions without programming

### Neural networks

    algorithms modeled after the human brain, uses interconnected nodes to identify patterns

### Deep learning

    A lot of neural networks used to analyze complex patterns in large datasets.
