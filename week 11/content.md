### Prevention of brute force

### 2FA

### Password hashing

### Rainbow table

    The hash for all password that can exist.
    still safe because because if this is used for all password that have 8 digits or more they'll need a lot of memory that only a supercomputer can do

### Salting

    adds random data to passwords before hashing, making attacks like dictionary and rainbow table harder.

### Secret-key Cryptography - Symmetric Cryptography

    uses the same key (a random secret) for both encryption and decryption, making it fast but requiring secure key sharing.

### Asymmetric Cryptography

    uses a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption, enhancing security without key sharing.

### End-to-End Encryption

    Dont want to trust the machine or anything that is not A or B, for example whatsapp messages

### Deleting files

    Deleting files do not delete them, just
